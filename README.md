# Blog-Storage

## Description
The blogs storage project was built to take inputs from a form and store the data in local storage.  Upon hitting the submit button we are redirected to the next page which renders the blog posts from local storage.  There is a back button that redirects you to the landing page to enter more blog posts.  There is a button called dark/light to toggle dark mode and light mode for the posted blog page.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Upon opening the page, the user is to enter text in all fields (username,title,blog entry) in order to submit a blog post .  If any of the fields are blank a pop-up will alert the user that they need to enter something in the associated field.  Once all of the fields are satisfied, the user will click on the submit button and be redirected to the next page where the blog posts will be posted.  Once on the blog post page, the user will be able to see the title, blog content, and who it was posted by.  On the top of the page there will be a back button which will take the user to the panding page to enter more posts as well as a dark/light mode toggle button.
